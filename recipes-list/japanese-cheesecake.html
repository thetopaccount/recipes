		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p class="description">This spongy, light cheesecake is good plain, with fresh fruit topping, or you can even frost it.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul class="recipelist">
			<li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed</li>
			<li>½ cup milk</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
			<li>10 tablespoons cake flour</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
			<li>6 egg yolks</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
			<li>6 egg whites</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
			<li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>10 tablespoons superfine sugar</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch round cake pan and line with parchment paper.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Place cream cheese in a bowl with milk; soak for 20 minutes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Heat cream cheese with milk and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely, at least 15 minutes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Sift cake flour and cornstarch together into a bowl. Sift again into the cream cheese mixture; mix well. Add egg yolks and lemon juice and mix well.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until foamy; add sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating on high speed until soft peaks form.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Fold cream cheese mixture into egg white mixture until well mixed; pour into the prepared pan. Place pan inside a larger baking dish and fill the baking dish with water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the cake pan.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is set and golden brown on top, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Turn off oven and leave cake in oven with door ajar for 1 hour. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
