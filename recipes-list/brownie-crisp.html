		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p class="description">Crisp and intense, the best part of the brownie! You can add a multitude of toppings such as salt, caramel, chocolate chips (mini), nuts, sprinkles, etc. You may as well double the recipe because they disappear fast.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul class="recipelist">
			<li>1 cup white sugar</li>
			<li>½ cup melted butter</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon espresso powder (Optional)</li>
			<li>2 egg whites, beaten</li>
			<li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
			<li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Combine sugar, butter, vanilla extract, and espresso powder together in a bowl; beat in egg whites. Stir flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Mix flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is combined. Spread batter as thin as a slice of American cheese onto the baking sheet.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Bake in the preheated oven until batter is nearly cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven; cut a shallow square pattern into the batter with a sharp knife. Place back into the oven; bake until batter is crisp, about 5 minutes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely; break into squares.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
